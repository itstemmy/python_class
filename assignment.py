# write a program that converts from 'g' to 'kg' and 'kg' to 'g'. the program should first ask the user to enter a value
# and then ask the user to enter the unit of the value entered. if it is 'g', it should convert it to 'kg' and vice versa.
# note: the unit should be case insensitive.
# solution
# value = float(input('enter value '))
# unit = input('enter unit-- kg or g ').casefold()

# if unit =="kg" :
#     print(value * 1000)
# elif unit== "g":
#     print(value / 1000)
# else:
#     print('unit does not exist')


# what is a loop? a loop is a control flow statement that is used to repeatedly
# execute a group of statements as long as a particular condition is satisfied. this is
# also known as iterative statement

# while loop: it is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the condition is true. it is used when we dont know the number of times to iterate before hand.
# for loop: iterates over an object until that object is complete. it uses the syntax: for item in object, where "object" is the iterable over which you want to iterate.
# break statement:it terminates the execution of the nearest enclosind do,for,switch,or while statement in which it appears.
# continue statement:it returns the control to the beginning of the while loop. it ends the current iteration of a loop.

# how to use pop() it is used to remove an element from the list. when the pop function is empty,
# it remove the last element from the list. we can specify the index of element to be deleted.

# del()
# copy()

# a function that adds two number together
